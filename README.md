This web app is a tool for model prediction. Both the random forest and logistic regression model have been trained on a dataset of startups which did not receive funding from Two Lanterns, consisting of just under 700 companies with around 477 columns (many of which are one-hot encodings). 

To use this tool to predict whether a startup will fail or succeed, please add 20 data points for each startup which will be used in prediction.
